# `_poolRepayAll()` function updates the state incorrectly, which might cause the vault to be exploited.

## Summary
`_poolRepayAll()` function updates the state incorrectly. It decrements the token balance instead of incrementing, which will affect future borrows and also make the vault prone to exploitation.

## Vulnerability Detail
Pools can borrow tokens from and repay tokens to the vault. There are two different repaying functions available in the [`D3Funding.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Funding.sol#L30-L46) contract which are `repay()` and `repayAll()`. These functions will be called by the pool owner and they will make an external call to the vault contract to trigger repayment functions.

While the `poolRepay()` function accurately updates the vault state, the `poolRepayAll()` function does the updating incorrectly in the `D3VaultFunding.sol` contract. When a borrow is repaid, token balances in the vault should be incremented.

Here is the poolRepay() function:  
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L107](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L107)

```solidity
//File: D3VaultFunding.sol
107.    info.balance = info.balance + amount;
108.    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

Here is the `_poolRepayAll()` function:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L129](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L129)

```solidity
//File: D3VaultFunding.sol
129.    info.balance = info.balance - amount;
130.    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(pool, address(this), amount);
```

As you can see above, the vault's real token balance will increase because of the transfer to the vault, but the recorded state balance will decrease when a pool wants to repay all the debt (line 129).

This situation will affect the pool's future borrows from the vault because the vault will think that there is not enough balance even though it's not true. The `poolBorrow()` function checks `info.balance` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L81):

```solidity
//File: D3VaultFunding.sol
81.  require(amount <= info.balance, Errors.AMOUNT_EXCEED_VAULT_BALANCE);
```

The impact I mentioned above is just a naive scenario where there is no attacker. An attacker can easily exploit the vault and cause catastrophic losses to the vault. Here is how:

The D3VaultFunding contract implements a two-step deposit in the `userDeposit()` function. It expects the users to send tokens first, and then call the function. After that, it calculates the difference between the real balance of the contract and previously recorded `info.balance`, and assumes the difference is sent by the user. The code is below:  
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L28-L45](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L28C1-L45C6)

```solidity
//File: D3VaultFunding.sol
28.   /// @notice user should transfer token to vault before call this function
29.   function userDeposit(address user, address token) external nonReentrant allowedToken(token) {
30.        accrueInterest(token);
31.
32.        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
33.-->     uint256 realBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
34.-->     uint256 amount = realBalance  - info.balance;
35.        require(ID3UserQuota(_USER_QUOTA_).checkQuota(user, token, amount), Errors.EXCEED_QUOTA);
36.        uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(token);
37.        uint256 totalDToken = IDToken(info.dToken).totalSupply();
38.        require(totalDToken.mul(exchangeRate) + amount <= info.maxDepositAmount, Errors.EXCEED_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
39.-->     uint256 dTokenAmount = amount.div(exchangeRate);
40.
41.-->     IDToken(info.dToken).mint(user, dTokenAmount);
42.        info.balance = realBalance;
43.
44.        emit UserDeposit(user, token, amount);
45.    }
```

The only thing that the attacker needs to do is to call the `userDeposit()` function right after a pool payment is done with the `_poolRepayAll()`.  
Because the `info.balance` is updated incorrectly, the attacker will be assumed to sent `amount` of tokens (*which is twice the pool's paid debt*) in lines 33-34, and that much `dTokens` will be minted to the attacker's address according to the exchange rate (Lines 39 - 41).

1. Let's assume token balance of the vault is 1000 and pool debt is 200.

2. The pool debt is paid with `_poolRepayAll()`. Actual token balance of the vault is 1200 but `info.balance` is 800.

3. Attacker watches the transactions, specifically watches for `_poolRepayAll()`
    
4. Attacker calls the `userDeposit()` immediately after the pool payment.
    
5. Attacker gains `dTokens` worth of 400 tokens without sending anything.
    

## Impact
* An attacker can earn lots of `dToken`'s without spending any money.
    
* The pool borrow function will not work correctly.

Changing this line `info.balance = info.balance - amount` to this: `info.balance = info.balance + amount`
